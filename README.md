# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview of Analysis
We were tasked to do an analysis on the Pewlett Hackard's employee information to determine the implications of the retiring workforce. We will compile data and use it to determine the amount of outgoing employees, and which ones would be eligible to train the incoming generation, and how viable that may be.

## Results
- We ran a query on the employees who were coming to retirement age withing the next three years. The query returned 90,398 employees, which means that 90,398 employees will have to be replaced.

- Most of the employees are from senior positions, which means that the jobs needing replaced are not going to be entry-level positions, and therefore will likely need to be trained from within the company, and the lower positions left open be replaced with new employees.

- The mentorship program allows eligible employees to train people to do their jobs before they retire, but will their be enough employees eligible for the program to train the amount of people require to fill the new positions?

- With only 1,549 employees eligible for the mentorship program, that means that each mentor would need to train 58 replacements over three years in order to replace the workforce without affecting performance and productivity.

## Summary
This seems like a near impossible task. However, once a query is run on the job title makeup of the non-retiring employees, one can see that there are enough current employees ready to be upgraded.

If every current engineer and staff employee were trained by the mentorship program to be promoted to senior level engineers and staff, there are suffient numbers to do so.

Though not ideal, the transition should be possible.
